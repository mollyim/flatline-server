ðŸš§ WARNING ðŸš§

The Flatline project is a work in progress.

This chart and its resources are unstable in order to facilitate development.

During development, several features will be disabled or insecurely implemented.

Do not run this in production environments.

---

Please, wait for the Whisper service to become ready. You can monitor this with the following command:

$ kubectl wait --timeout=5m -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} deployment/{{ include "common.fullname" .}}-whisper-service --for=condition=Available

{{ if .Values.traefikResources.enabled -}}
Since you have chosen to use the development Traefik resources, you can find the relevant Flatline endpoints here:

- Whisper Service: https://{{ .Values.traefikResources.hostname}}/whisper/
- Whisper Service Admin: https://{{ .Values.traefikResources.hostname}}/whisper/admin/
- Storage Service: https://{{ .Values.traefikResources.hostname}}/storage/
- Storage Service Admin: https://{{ .Values.traefikResources.hostname}}/storage/admin
- Contact Discovery Service: https://{{ .Values.traefikResources.hostname}}/cds/
{{ else -}}
Since you have chosen to use your own ingress gateway, ensure that the relevant Flatline endpoints are exposed:

- Whisper Service on its default port.
- Storage Service on its default port.
- Contact Discovery Service on its default port.

These endpoints need to be reachable through TLS by the client applications.
